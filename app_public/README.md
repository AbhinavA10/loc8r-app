Angular Front end for our application

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
```
ng build --prod --output-path build
```


## Notes
In Angular, double curly brackets are used to denote a binding between the data and the view. 
The value is probably defined in the ts file for the same component.
